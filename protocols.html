      <h1>About the Bibliography</h1>
      <p>From Helvetia Martell in <i>Hispanic Periodicals in the United States: Origins to 1960 A Brief History and Comprehensive Bibliography</i>, pp. 137-8.</p>
      <p class="lead">Objectives</p>
        <p>Identifying, locating, and making accessible the publications of a people whose intellectual production was ignored by most institutions responsible for bibliographic control (publication, preservation, and access) are very large and at times frustrating tasks. 
           Nevertheless, we took on the compilation of this bibliography as part of Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage to support reconstituting the documentary legacy of Hispanics in the United States. The present bibliography offers a list of periodical publications whose pages have survived in some form, or whose existence is remembered only through bibliographic documentation, because to date no vestiges of the original serial have been recovered.</p>
        <p>Our list contains some 1,700 records, of which only some 900 titles are accessible in one form or another. All of those serials that are missing bear the annotation "No extant issues located." [...]</p>
        <p>The criteria used for inclusion of records in this list were: (1) all known serials published in the Spanish language in the United States; and (2) all known serials published in the United States, whether English or bilingually (Spanish-English), that were produced by or that served US Hispanic communities.</p>
                    
      <p class="lead">Sources</p>
        <p>The titles included were located in various electronic and print sources, as well as through direct contact with individuals and by research in various institutions. In some cases, the Recovery Program itself discovered the serials, microfilmed them, and is now making them universally accessible for the first time since the publications' demise.
                     The electronic sources most relied upon were the public catalogs of the Library of Congress (LOCIS-LOC), WorldCat (the OCLC Online Union Catalog), and catalogs of individual libraries....For any title that can be found only in print catalogs, and for which we found no repository, we have reproduced the catalog entry as cited in the particular source....</p>
                     
      <p class="lead">Bibliographic Information</p>
                     <p>Each entry contains information on the title, place of publication, publisher, and dates of publication. When these data do not appear in the serial itself, external sources have been used to provide the information. Because not all of the issues of these publications have survived, and because even the publications often do not provide clear bibliographic information, determining actual dates of origin and demise has been an arduous task.
                     When the dates cannot be verifies, we substitute for the missing dates a <b>lower-case "u"</b>....
                     Any approximate date offered is always accompanied by a <b>question mark: "(?)."</b>
                                                                                                     A <b>dash</b> immediately after the beginning date indicates that the serial is still publishing, or that we do not know of its demise.                                                                            
                     ....</p>
                    <p>Our bibliography does not pretend to be exhaustive, nor is it definitive. 
                       We hope that by making the results of our reserach available, other titles not on our list will surface, and that some of our "non-extant" titles will also come to light.
                       <b>We invite our readers to provide us with additional information, sources, and titles.</b></p>
